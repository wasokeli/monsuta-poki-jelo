# Pokémon Yellow: Toki Pona Sandbox

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow, with a set of changes to make it easy to translate into Toki Pona. It's based on [pret](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow), followed by jan Ketesi's changes to increase the number of available Sitelen Pona words, followed by waso Keli's changes to set it up for translation.

This repo is *not*, itself, a translation. It's just getting the technicals out of the way so you can translate the game yourself! Click "forks" on the sidebar -> to see what other people have done.

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
